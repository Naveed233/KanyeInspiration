ðŸš€ Getting Started: A Guide for the Chosen
To get this divine inspiration flowing on your machine, you'll need to follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Python: Make sure you have Python 3 installed. If not, go get it. What are you waiting for?
Pip: This should come with your Python installation.
Installation & Setup
Create Your Project Folder

Make a new folder and create three files inside it:

main.py
background.png (You'll need to find a 300x414 pixel image)
kanye.png (This will be your button, so a small image of Kanye's head is perfect)
Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command. This installs the requests library. Tkinter comes standard with Python, because even Python knows what's good.

Bash

pip install requests
Add the Code

Paste the entire code block below into your main.py file.

Python

from tkinter import *
import requests



def get_quote():
	response = requests.get("https://api.kanye.rest/")
	response.raise_for_status()
	data = response.json()
	quote = data["quote"]
	canvas.itemconfig(quote_text, text=quote)



window = Tk()
window.title("Kanye Says...")
   window.config(padx=50, pady=50)

canvas = Canvas(width=300, height=414)
background_img = PhotoImage(file="background.png")
canvas.create_image(150, 207, image=background_img)
quote_text = canvas.create_text(150, 207, text="Kanye says..", width=250, font=("Arial", 20, "bold"), fill="white")
canvas.grid(row=0, column=0)

kanye_img = PhotoImage(file="kanye.png")
kanye_button = Button(image=kanye_img, highlightthickness=0, command=get_quote)
kanye_button.grid(row=1, column=0)



window.mainloop()
```

*(Note: The font size was slightly reduced so that more of Kanye's wisdom can fit on the screen. You're welcome.)*
Run the Application

In your terminal, navigate to your project folder and run the script:

Bash

python main.py
Receive the Gospel

Click the Kanye button and let the inspiration wash over you.

"I will go down as the voice of this generation, of this decade, I will be the loudest voice."

Now you have a piece of that voice on your desktop. Use it wisely. Or don't. He's not the boss of you. But he is a genius.
